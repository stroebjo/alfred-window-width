Window Width Alfred Workflow
============================

Workflow to set the width of the window with the current focus. I use it to resize my browser windows when doing website development for mobile devices. It provides common screen sizes from mobile devices like tablets and smartphones out of the box, but also allows you to set the window width to a custom value.

Use `ww {$width}` to set the window to a custom width. Like `ww 1600`.
